# icarogw 2.0 Developers branch

## Installation

Simply run

```
pip install git+https://github.com/simone-mastrogiovanni/icarogw.git
```

To install the latest version of icarogw


### Installing the GPU CUDA version

To use the GPU/CUDA version you need to install cupy. After your installation is complete, just run

```
conda install -c conda-forge cupy==12.0
```

## Some details

When you are using icarogw2.0, you can put inside your working folder a file called `config.py` containing

```latex
CUPY=False
```

if you do not want to use the GPU. IF you want to use the GPU, remember to use cupy instead of numpy
